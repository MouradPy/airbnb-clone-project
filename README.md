Admins can manage users and monitor the platform.

## Property Management
Hosts can create, edit, and delete property listings.  
Each property includes details such as title, description, price, images, and availability.  
This allows the platform to maintain a catalog of properties for guests to browse.

## Booking System
Guests can search for available properties and make bookings for specific dates.  
The system calculates the total cost and manages booking confirmation.  
Bookings are linked to both users and properties for proper tracking.

This feature ensures smooth transactions and financial tracking.

Reviews help future guests make informed decisions and maintain quality on the platform.  
Hosts can respond to reviews to improve guest satisfaction.

## Notifications

This ensures smooth communication between guests, hosts, and the platform.

# Feature Breakdown

## User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.  
Guests can book properties, while hosts can list and manage their properties.  
Admins can manage users and monitor the platform.

## Property Management
Hosts can create, edit, and delete property listings.  
Each property includes details such as title, description, price, images, and availability.  
This allows the platform to maintain a catalog of properties for guests to browse.

## Booking System
Guests can search for available properties and make bookings for specific dates.  
The system calculates the total cost and manages booking confirmation.  
Bookings are linked to both users and properties for proper tracking.

## Payment Integration
Guests can pay securely through integrated payment gateways (e.g., Stripe).  
Payments are linked to bookings to ensure proper accounting.  
This feature ensures smooth transactions and financial tracking.

## Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in.  
Reviews help future guests make informed decisions and maintain quality on the platform.  
Hosts can respond to reviews to improve guest satisfaction.

## Notifications
Users receive notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, and updates.  
This ensures smooth communication between guests, hosts, and the platform.  

## Search & Filtering
Guests can search properties based on location, price, and availability.  
Filtering options allow users to narrow down results to match their preferences.  
This improves the user experience and helps users find the right property quickly.
# API Security

## Authentication
All users must log in to access protected endpoints.  
This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data, such as booking information and personal details.

## Authorization
Different roles (guest, host, admin) have access to specific resources and actions.  
This prevents users from performing actions they are not allowed to, protecting the integrity of the system.

## Data Validation & Sanitization
All input data is validated and sanitized before being processed or stored.  
This prevents common attacks such as SQL injection or XSS, safeguarding the database and user information.

## Rate Limiting
API requests are limited to prevent abuse or DDoS attacks.  
This ensures the service remains available and responsive for legitimate users.

## Encryption
Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.  
This protects user data from interception or unauthorized access.

## Secure Payment Handling
Payment data is processed through secure third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe).  
This ensures financial information is protected and reduces liability for the platform.
# CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code.  
CI/CD ensures that new features or bug fixes are tested and deployed reliably, reducing errors and improving development efficiency.

For this project, the CI/CD pipeline could include:

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment whenever new code is pushed to the repository.  
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments for development, testing, and production.  
- **Automated Tests:** Run unit and integration tests to catch issues before deployment.  
- **Deployment:** Automatically deploy successful builds to staging or production servers.

Implementing CI/CD helps maintain high code quality, faster release cycles, and stable application performance.
